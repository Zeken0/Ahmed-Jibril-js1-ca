## Brief
1 Go through the list of API's from git that you were shown last week Friday.

2 Ensure that if you add the id to the URL its brings back a specific result like we demonstrated today in class.

3 Choose an API.

4 Please dont use an API from any of the lessons

5 It must be an API with an array inside it.

## Level 1 Process
- Create an index.html. Create cards for each result(object) from your API Array.
- Show atleast 2 properties from each object(For the index page).
- Ensure that you create a button to click through to a single details page.
- On the detail page, use the url you have chosen + the id for the object.
- You will need to extract the id from the URL like todays lesson.
- Query the API for a single result using the URL with the ID appended to it.
- Show more details on the detail page, like images, descriptions etc.
- Set the title of the page to something meaninful from the object.
- Use a loading gif for the index.html page and for the details page.
- When your results load hide the loading gif.
- Use the alert.js file to show any errors if there are any.
- Make sure to use try catch and finally.

## Level 2 Process
> reminder: level 2 is optional
- Extract the query string code into a function which returns an ID
